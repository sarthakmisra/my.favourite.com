       <p>I like reading books and sometimes when I am free I read knowlegable books which has a lot of information about our body,universe,space,etc. and I don't like story books much I like interesting facts about the world because this tells us about the hidden secrets of world and the animals which don't wanna come in front of humans and they are still a mystery and some of them are extinct many books tell that dinosaurs are not the only animals which are extinct,there are many huge creatures their body cover the whole world there are many interesting facts in the books it even tells us about plants, animals and mountains also some facts about mountains like Ayers is a hill which changes its colour and this hill was discovered by WG Gosse.</p>
